\begin{verse}[\versewidth]

\FirstVerse{J}{esus,} my Lord, my God, my all,\\*
How can I love Thee as I ought?\\*
And how revere this wondrous gift,\\*
So far surpassing hope or
thought?

\begin{patverse}
\flagverse{Refrain:} \vin Sweet Sacrament, we Thee adore;\\*
\vin Oh, make us love Thee more and more. 
\end{patverse}

\flagverse{2} Had I but Mary's sinless heart\\*
To love Thee with, my dearest King,\\*
Oh, with what bursts of fervent praise\\*
Thy goodness, Jesus, would I sing!


%\flagverse{3} Ah see! Within a creature's hand\\*
%The vast Creator deigns to be,\\*
%Reposing, infant-like, as though\\*
%On Joseph’s arm, or Mary’s knee.


%\flagverse{4} Thy Body, Soul, and Godhead, all;\\*
%O mystery of love divine!\\*
%I cannot compass all I have,\\*
%For all Thou hast and art are mine; 


\flagverse{5} Sound, sound His praises higher still,\\*
And come, ye angels, to our aid;\\*
'Tis God, 'tis God, the very God,\\*
Whose power both man and angels made

\end{verse}
